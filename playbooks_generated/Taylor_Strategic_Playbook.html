<h2>Framework 2: Workflow Discovery and Refinement Framework</h2>
<p><strong>Type:</strong> process_framework
<strong>Confidence:</strong> 0.96
<strong>Evidence Sources:</strong> 1</p>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>A systematic approach to understanding, documenting, and refining existing workflows before implementing automation or AI solutions. This framework ensures that solution design is grounded in actual work patterns, quality requirements, and measurable outcomes rather than assumptions about how work should be done.</p>
<h3>Core Principle</h3>
<p>Effective workflow refinement requires deep understanding of current state operations, including unwritten quality standards and implicit knowledge that practitioners use but may not articulate without structured inquiry</p>
<h3>When to Use</h3>
<p>Before implementing AI or automation solutions for existing manual processes, especially when the work involves judgment calls, quality assessments, or complex decision-making that isn't fully documented</p>
<h3>When NOT to Use</h3>
<p>For entirely new processes with no existing baseline, or for simple, well-documented processes where requirements are already clear and agreed upon</p>
<h3>Components</h3>
<h4>Component 1: Current State Discovery</h4>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Map the actual workflow as it exists today, including all variations and exceptions</p>
<p><strong>Key Activities:</strong>

- Document each step and decision point in the process
- Identify all inputs, outputs, and quality checkpoints</p>
<p><strong>Success Criteria:</strong>
- ✓ Practitioner validates the documented workflow as accurate
- ✓ All edge cases and exceptions are captured</p>
<p><strong>Common Pitfalls:</strong>
- ⚠️  Accepting high-level descriptions without drilling into specifics
- ⚠️  Missing informal quality checks that aren't officially documented</p>
<h4>Component 2: Quality Standards Elicitation</h4>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Extract and codify the implicit and explicit quality criteria that define successful outcomes</p>
<p><strong>Key Activities:</strong>
- Interview practitioners about their quality bars
- Review examples of good vs. poor outputs
- Identify non-negotiable requirements versus nice-to-haves</p>
<p><strong>Success Criteria:</strong>
- ✓ Quality criteria are measurable and specific
- ✓ Practitioners agree the standards reflect their actual evaluation process</p>
<p><strong>Common Pitfalls:</strong>
- ⚠️  Assuming quality standards are uniform across all cases
- ⚠️  Focusing only on documented standards while missing tacit knowledge</p>
<h4>Component 3: Workflow Optimization Design</h4>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Design refined workflow that maintains quality while improving efficiency</p>
<p><strong>Key Activities:</strong>
- Identify bottlenecks and redundancies in current workflow
- Design automation opportunities that preserve quality gates
- Create feedback loops for continuous refinement</p>
<p><strong>Success Criteria:</strong>
- ✓ Refined workflow reduces effort without compromising quality
- ✓ New workflow is testable against defined quality standards</p>
<p><strong>Common Pitfalls:</strong>
- ⚠️  Over-automating without understanding nuanced decision points
- ⚠️  Designing for ideal conditions rather than real-world variability</p>
<h3>Implementation Guide</h3>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong>
1. Schedule working sessions with actual practitioners doing the work
2. Observe and document the complete workflow including all variations
3. Extract and validate quality standards through specific examples
4. Design refined workflow maintaining essential quality gates
5. Test refined workflow against real scenarios before full implementation</p>
