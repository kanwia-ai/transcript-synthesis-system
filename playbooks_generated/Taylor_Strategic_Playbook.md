## Framework 4: Use Case Desert Framework

**Type:** model_framework
**Confidence:** 0.86
**Evidence Sources:** 2

### Definition
A diagnostic and intervention framework for organizations experiencing high AI literacy but low practical application - where teams understand AI capabilities but fail to identify or implement meaningful use cases. This framework bridges the gap between theoretical proficiency and operational value creation through systematic use case discovery and activation.

### Core Principle
The framework works because it recognizes that AI adoption failure isn't typically about technical knowledge deficiency, but rather about the inability to translate abstract capabilities into concrete business applications - requiring structured exploration methods to navigate from competency to implementation.

#### Component 3: Application Acceleration Pipeline

**Purpose:** Transform identified use cases into operational implementations with minimal friction

**Key Activities:**
- Develop rapid prototyping protocols for testing use cases
- Create lightweight governance that encourages experimentation
- Build reusable components and templates for common patterns

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ Average time from use case identification to pilot under 2 weeks
- ✓ 70% of pilots convert to production implementations

**Common Pitfalls:**
- ⚠️  Over-engineering pilots instead of testing minimum viable applications
- ⚠️  Lacking clear escalation paths from pilot to production

### Implementation Guide

**Steps:**
1. Conduct baseline assessment measuring both proficiency scores and active use case count
2. Map the specific 'desert zones' where knowledge exists without application
3. Launch targeted use case discovery workshops in highest-gap areas
4. Establish rapid experimentation protocols with clear success metrics
