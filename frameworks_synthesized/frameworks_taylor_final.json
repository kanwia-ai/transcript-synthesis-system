Allow spontaneous interactions to happen naturally and only use tier reminders when you realize time has passed without contact. Personalize every touchpoint significantly.",
        "Risk: Creating unsustainable commitments in Tier 1 \u2192 Mitigation: Start conservatively with fewer Tier 1 contacts (5-8) and only add after proving you can maintain quality. Set realistic contact frequencies (monthly is minimum, not maximum). Build in buffer weeks for overwhelm. It's better to have fewer, well-maintained relationships than many neglected ones.",
        "Risk: People discovering they're 'tiered' and feeling offended \u2192 Mitigation: Never discuss the framework using tier language externally. Keep all documentation private and password-protected. If asked about your networking approach, describe it as 'being intentional about staying connected with people who matter' without ranking language. Never compare contacts to each other.",
        "Risk: Tier classifications becoming outdated as situations change \u2192 Mitigation: Schedule mandatory quarterly reviews (add to calendar as recurring non-negotiable appointment). Watch for signals: changed job, life event, increased/decreased contact frequency, shifts in strategic alignment. Allow mid-quarter adjustments for significant changes. Document reasons for tier changes.",
        "Risk: Neglecting Tier 2 and 3 relationships entirely \u2192 Mitigation: Set minimum viable touchpoints for all tiers. Tier 2: minimum quarterly value-add or engagement. Tier 3: annual check-in or consistent social media engagement. Use batching techniques (send 5 Tier 2 check-ins in one focused hour). Remember: today's Tier 3 could be tomorrow's Tier 1.",
        "Risk: Mixing professional tiering with personal worth/affection \u2192 Mitigation: Remember tiers reflect strategic professional priority and time capacity, not personal affection or human value. You may deeply like a Tier 3 contact but lack professional overlap. Conversely, some Tier 1 contacts may be professionally critical but not close friends. Separate professional networking from friendship.",
        "Risk: System becoming burdensome administrative work \u2192 Mitigation: Keep tracking simple (spreadsheet or basic CRM). Spend 90% of time on actual relationship building, 10% on documentation. Batch administrative tasks (update all notes monthly). Use calendar reminders rather than constant system checking. If system takes more than 30 minutes weekly to maintain, simplify it.",
        "Risk: One-sided relationships where you're always initiating \u2192 Mitigation: Track reciprocity patterns\u2014if someone never initiates after 4-5 quality outreach attempts, demote a tier. Your energy is finite. Tier 1 should be largely reciprocal. Some Tier 2/3 relationships may be asymmetric (mentors, industry leaders) which is fine if the value justifies it. Don't waste Tier 1 energy on non-reciprocal relationships.",
        "Risk: Treating life transitions (job changes, relocations) inadequately \u2192 Mitigation: Flag major life events in tracking system. Temporarily increase contact frequency during transitions (Tier 2 may get Tier 1 attention during their career change). These moments strengthen relationships\u2014be present. Set alerts for typical transition seasons (graduation time, year-end job changes). Proactive support during transitions builds lasting goodwill.",
        "Risk: Cultural differences in communication expectations \u2192 Mitigation: Research and respect cultural communication norms for international contacts. Some cultures expect more frequent contact, others value space. Adjust tier touchpoint frequencies based on individual and cultural preferences. When unsure, ask directly: 'What's the best way to stay connected with you?' Document preferences in tracking system."
