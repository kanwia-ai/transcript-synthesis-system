          "criteria": "Pure approach (share only in meeting) ensures everyone reads simultaneously and prevents pre-formed political positions. Send in advance if: participants need accessibility accommodations, document requires technical background review, or organizational culture strongly resists in-meeting reading. Hybrid works for executive audiences who need prep time but benefit from synchronized review."

Consider: document complexity, participant familiarity with topic, average reading speed (250-300 words per minute), and importance of thorough comprehension. Always err on side of more time; can end early if all finish."

Facilitator should have 3-5 prepared questions targeting: key assumptions, alternative approaches, implementation concerns, and resource implications.

Direct link with cameras-on policy creates accountability. For large groups (>15), consider breakout rooms of 5-7 for discussion phase. Always use timer visible to all participants.

        "Risk: Document is poorly written or overly complex \u2192 Mitigation: Mandatory peer review by 2-3 people before distribution; use plain language guidelines (8th-10th grade reading level); include executive summary; test document with someone unfamiliar with topic; limit jargon and define necessary technical terms",
        "Risk: Cultural resistance or perception of wasted time \u2192 Mitigation: Senior leader sponsorship and modeling; start with pilot team of early adopters; share efficiency metrics (fewer follow-up meetings, faster decisions); collect and publicize participant feedback showing value; explain research on synchronous reading benefits",
        "Risk: Accessibility barriers for participants with different needs \u2192 Mitigation: Provide document 24 hours early for those using screen readers; offer alternative formats (large print, audio recording); allow extended reading time for those who request it; ensure document uses accessible design (sufficient contrast, readable fonts, alt text for images)",
        "Risk: Discussion dominated by senior voices or loudest participants \u2192 Mitigation: Facilitator actively solicits diverse perspectives; use round-robin initial reactions; implement 'two-statement rule' (can't speak third time until everyone has spoken twice); anonymous question submission during reading period; designate someone to specifically represent contrarian view",
        "Risk: Document author becomes defensive during critical discussion \u2192 Mitigation: Establish norm that document represents team thinking, not personal work; separate author from presenter role when possible; facilitator frames criticism as strengthening ideas, not attacking author; author takes notes rather than responding to every comment; decision-maker explicitly thanks author before critique begins",
        "Risk: Meeting runs over time due to lengthy discussion \u2192 Mitigation: Clearly prioritize discussion topics in document structure; assign time limits to each section; facilitator uses parking lot for tangential issues; focus on decisions that need to be made in this meeting vs. what can be offline follow-up; schedule decision meetings, not discussion meetings",
        "Risk: Important context or data is missing from document \u2192 Mitigation: Include comprehensive appendices for supporting data; author's final review checklist asking 'What questions will this raise?'; pre-meeting document review by key stakeholders; build in 'what's missing?' as first discussion question; maintain living document that can be updated post-meeting",
        "Risk: No clear decisions or action items emerge \u2192 Mitigation: Document must explicitly state decisions needed; facilitator prepared with decision-forcing questions; use decision framework (one-way vs. two-way doors); assign decision-maker role clearly in advance; end meeting with explicit recap of decisions and next steps; follow-up document within 24 hours",
        "Risk: Virtual participants are distracted during reading period \u2192 Mitigation: Require cameras on; use engagement features (reactions, polls); shorter documents for virtual-only meetings; scheduled breaks before reading period; eliminate calendar conflicts by blocking adequate time; screen share document to reduce window-switching; facilitator monitors engagement signals"
