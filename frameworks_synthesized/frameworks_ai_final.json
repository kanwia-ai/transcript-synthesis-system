        "Risk: Cultural resistance or perception of wasted time \u2192 Mitigation: Senior leader sponsorship and modeling; start with pilot team of early adopters; share efficiency metrics (fewer follow-up meetings, faster decisions); collect and publicize participant feedback showing value; explain research on synchronous reading benefits",

        "Risk: Discussion dominated by senior voices or loudest participants \u2192 Mitigation: Facilitator actively solicits diverse perspectives; use round-robin initial reactions; implement 'two-statement rule' (can't speak third time until everyone has spoken twice); anonymous question submission during reading period; designate someone to specifically represent contrarian view",

        "Risk: No clear decisions or action items emerge \u2192 Mitigation: Document must explicitly state decisions needed; facilitator prepared with decision-forcing questions; use decision framework (one-way vs. two-way doors); assign decision-maker role clearly in advance; end meeting with explicit recap of decisions and next steps; follow-up document within 24 hours",
        "Risk: Virtual participants are distracted during reading period \u2192 Mitigation: Require cameras on; use engagement features (reactions, polls); shorter documents for virtual-only meetings; scheduled breaks before reading period; eliminate calendar conflicts by blocking adequate time; screen share document to reduce window-switching; facilitator monitors engagement signals"
